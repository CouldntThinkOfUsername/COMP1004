# SINGLE PAGE WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

# COMP1004

Project overview

My single page application (SPA) was created to assist people or organisations in password storage and management operations. It will take note of the site, the username/email of their account and their password. My goal is to create a password management application that can be used by organisations, or individuals to help manage the login details of multiple accounts in one, easy to use and effective tool, minimising the amount of time spent resetting or remembering passwords for several accounts.

Using multiple passwords is always the best practice, however, people are put off by having to remember several different passwords for different things, which can lead to a huge risk to their online security in the event of a data breach. This is why my application will help people use different passwords without the worry and headache of trying to remember which is which. 


--- How it works ---
It utilises a Binary level object (BLOB) to write the details provided by the user to a formatted JSON file.
It uses random number generation (RNG) to create passswords for the user to use.
It has the ability to read user login information stored in the formatted files and output them in a readable format.

---Future features ---
+ A fully functional login system
+ Data encryption when saving the credentials
+ Account creation
+ Real time appending of credential list
